ITEA Room Setup Form — CSS Styling
==================================

This project enhances the ITEA Room Setup HTML form using custom **external CSS styling**. The design focuses on readability, cleanliness, and user experience, without using any third-party CSS libraries or inline styles.

---

🎨 Styling Approach
-------------------
All styles are written in an external file called `style.css`, linked in the HTML using:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

Inline CSS is strictly avoided, and no external libraries like Bootstrap were used, as per project requirements.

💡 Features
-----------
- **Clean layout** with fieldsets clearly separating form sections
- **Responsive design** with centered form container and adaptive width
- **Readable fonts** and consistent font sizes
- **Styled inputs** (text fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes)
- **Hover effects** on submit and reset buttons
- **Placeholder styling** for visual guidance
- **Optional image or branding element** at the top of the form
- **Creative decoration** through spacing, color, and layout
