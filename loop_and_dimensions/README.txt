Exercise 3: Python Looping Challenges
=====================================

This activity focuses on using sequential loops, nested loops, and conditional statements in Python.

A. Sequential Loops
-------------------
Using only a **sequential loop** (not nested), create a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to nÂ² in a square matrix format.

Example: When n = 5, your program should print numbers from 1 to 25 arranged in a 5x5 grid.

B. Nested Loops and Conditional Statements
------------------------------------------
Study the code output of `draw_sqr.py`. Then, using **nested loops** and **conditional statements**, create a Python program that draws a right triangle pattern in the terminal.

C. BONUS: Sequential Version of Part B
--------------------------------------
As a bonus challenge, create a version of Part B using only a **sequential loop** (no nested loops). Replicate the triangle figure using this constraint.
