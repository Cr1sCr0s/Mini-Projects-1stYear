The Stream Game Store (Persistent Version)
==========================================

This updated version of The Stream Game Store includes **file-based persistence**. It stores and retrieves game inventory and balance information across sessions using a simple `.dat` file format. This enables the store to maintain data even after the program is closed and reopened.
