GWA Calculator for Students
===========================

This program allows a student to compute their General Weighted Average (GWA) for 1 semester (5 subjects).

The program will first ask for the nature of the semester when the grades were obtained:
- Pandemic
- Pre/Post-Pandemic

The grades and number of units for each course will then be entered. After processing, the program will:
- Calculate and display the GWA
- Display the corresponding Latin honor (if the GWA qualifies)
- Notify the student if they fall under Scholastic Delinquency
- Warn if unit overload conditions are not met

Latin Honors:
-------------
Summa Cum Laude         → GWA ≤ 1.20  
Magna Cum Laude         → 1.20 < GWA ≤ 1.45  
Cum Laude               → 1.45 < GWA ≤ 1.75

Scholastic Delinquency:
-----------------------
Warning                  → 2 subjects with grades 4.00 or 5.00 (25–49% of total academic units)  
Probation                → 3 subjects (50–75% of total academic units)  
Dismissal                → 4 subjects (>75% but <100% of total academic units)  
Permanent Disqualification → 5 subjects (100% of total academic units)

Special Rules:
--------------
- For Pre/Post-Pandemic semesters: Latin honors require at least 15 total units.
- For Pandemic semesters: Latin honors require at least 12 total units.
- If total units ≥ 20, an Overload Permit is required. If no permit is filed, the student will be notified that some courses will be dropped.
