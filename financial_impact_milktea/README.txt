A Python program that will show the financial impact of sustaining one ºs milktea buying habit.

The program:

 2. Allow the user to specify the price of their usual milktea order.
 3. Show the user how much they will be spending on milktea per year.
 4. Show the user the saving vs. spending impact of their habit using 1,5,10,20,and 40year time frames.

Uses the Formula for Future Value (with Periodic Deposits and Annual CompoundingP)

Assumptions:
 1. Interest rate is 4.00% APY. As of this writing, this figure is on the conservative
 (non-promotional) side of published interest rates from digital banks in the Philippines . Most
 are even higher but only ffective for a limited (promotional) time.
 2. Deposits are made at the end of the periodic year.
 3. Interest amounts are calculated / compounded at the end of the periodic year.
